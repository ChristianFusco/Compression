This is my buggy file compression algorithim that I wrote during winter break of 2015.  By using a text analysis, I can determine the most commonly used characters in a text file.  Those characters are then represented with more or less bits depending on how frequently they are used.  There are a few bugs with the program, reading .exe files doesn't always work out, for example. Another bug is that sometimes an extra character is left behind after decompression.  Most of the bugs are easily fixed, I just lost interest in the project :(
